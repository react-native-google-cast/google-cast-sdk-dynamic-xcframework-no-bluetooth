# google-cast-sdk-dynamic-xcframework-no-bluetooth

The Cast iOS SDK supports XCFrameworks, allowing for development on Mac computers with Apple silicon, along with debugging using the iOS Simulator.

However, Google currently only provides the XCFrameworks as a [manual download](https://developers.google.com/cast/docs/ios_sender#xcframework).

This is an unofficial pod that can be used in a CocoaPods environment, such as the react-native-google-cast package.

## Installation

Add the following line to your Podfile:

```ruby
pod 'google-cast-sdk-dynamic-xcframework-no-bluetooth'
```

Versions of this pod follow the official Google SDK versioning.
